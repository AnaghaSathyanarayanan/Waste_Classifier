# 🌍🔍 Real-Time Garbage Classification & AR Data Visualization Project🗑️🚀♻️

Welcome to the Real-Time Garbage Classification and Augmented Reality (AR) Data Visualization project! This repository showcases an innovative combination of machine learning, AR, and real-time data interaction to enhance waste management through cutting-edge technology.

## 🔍 Project Components

**1. 📊 Garbage Classification Model***
Model: A TensorFlow-based image classification model trained on a dataset of 6 garbage categories: plastic, paper, metal, glass, organic, and others.
Artifacts: The trained model and saved artifacts are located in the model folder.

**2. 🌐 API & Backend**
API: Flask/FastAPI-based API that serves the ML model, with model tracking through MLflow.

**3. 🕶️ AR Visualization**
Platform: AR is developed using Unity with ARFoundation, enabling real-time overlays of classification data on objects detected via camera.

## Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Python
- **Model Serving**: MLflow
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Unity, C#
- **Backend**: Python, REST API
- **Deployment**: MLflow Server

## 🛣️ Future Roadmap
**🔥 Next Steps:**

- Real-Time Waste Detection: Move from static image-based classification to processing live video feeds.
- Enhanced AR Visualization: Build a polished AR interface for users to scan environments and visualize classification results in real-time.
- Mobile Integration: Extend the AR functionality to mobile platforms (iOS and Android).

## 💡 Project Inspiration

This project aims to bridge the gap between machine learning and augmented reality, offering a powerful tool for environmental sustainability. By bringing advanced technologies into waste management, we hope to make a significant impact on how waste is classified, tracked, and managed globally.
